<b>Native ZFS for Linux!</b>  ZFS is an advanced file system and volume manager which was originally developed for Solaris.  It has been successfully ported to FreeBSD and now there is a functional Linux ZFS kernel port too.  The port currently includes a fully functional and stable SPA, DMU, and ZVOL with a ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) on the way!
