Sorry, there is no working ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) just yet.

But there is good news.  Work on finishing the posix layer in this code base has been under way by "KQ Infotech":http://kqinfotech.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/hello-world/ for a while now.

Personally, I would love to see a FUSE based implementation too.  Currently all the zfs code in this project builds cleanly in the kernel as a module and in user space as a dynamic library used by ztest.  It seems to me it should mainly be a matter of adding the needed FUSE bits which the "ZFS-FUSE folks":http://zfs-fuse.net/ clearly showed us can be done!  I think it would be very nice to have all this all in a single code base.
