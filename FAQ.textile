h2. 1.1 What about the “licensing” issue?

In a nutshell, the issue is that the Linux kernel which is licensed under the "GNU General Public License":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html is "incompatible":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CDDL with ZFS which is licensed under the Sun "CDDL":http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/opensolaris_license.  While both the GPL and CDDL are open source licenses their terms are such that it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both licenses.  This means that a single _derived work_ of the Linux kernel and ZFS cannot be legally _distributed_.

One way to resolve this issue is to implement "ZFS in user space with FUSE":http://zfs-fuse.net/ where it is not considered a _derived work_ of the kernel.  This approach resolves the licensing issues but it has some technical drawbacks.  There is another option though.  The CDDL does not restrict modification and release of the ZFS source code which is "publicly available":http://dlc.sun.com/osol/on/downloads/current/ as part of OpenSolaris.  The ZFS code can be modified to build as a CDDL licensed kernel module which is _not distributed_ as part of the Linux kernel.  This makes a Native ZFS on Linux implementation possible if you are willing to "download":http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/downloads and "build it":http://wiki.github.com/behlendorf/zfs/building-zfs yourself.

h2. 1.2 Why should I use a 64-bit system?

fn1.In the Solaris kernel it is common practice to make heavy use of the virtual address space because it is designed to work well. However, in the Linux kernel most memory is addressed with a physical address and use of the virtual address space is strongly discouraged. This is particularly true on 32-bit arches where the virtual address space is limited to roughly 100MiB. Using the virtual address space on 64-bit Linux kernels is also discouraged.  But in this case the address space is so much larger than physical memory it is not as much of an issue. The right long term solution would be to update zfs to use scatter-gather lists, but that is a substantial change. For now just use a 64-bit system.

h2. 1.3 How can I help?

The most helpful thing you can do is to try ZFS for Linux on your system and report any "issues":http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues.  If you like what you see and would like to contribute to the project please send "me":http://github.com/behlendorf an email.  There are quite a few open issues on the "issue tracker":http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues which need attention or if you have an idea of your own that is fine too.
