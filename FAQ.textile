h2. 1.1 What about the “licensing” issue?

In a nutshell, the issue is that the Linux kernel which is licensed under the "GNU General Public License":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html is "incompatible":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CDDL with ZFS which is licensed under the Sun "CDDL":http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/opensolaris_license.  While both the GPL and CDDL are open source licenses their terms are such that it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both licenses.  This means that a single _derived work_ of the Linux kernel and ZFS cannot be legally _distributed_.

One way to resolve this issue is to implement "ZFS in user space with FUSE":http://zfs-fuse.net/ where it is not considered a _derived work_ of the kernel.  This approach resolves the licensing issues but it has some technical drawbacks.  There is another option though.  The CDDL does not restrict modification and release of the ZFS source code which is "publicly available":http://dlc.sun.com/osol/on/downloads/current/ as part of OpenSolaris.  The ZFS code can be modified to build as a CDDL licensed kernel module which is _not distributed_ as part of the Linux kernel.  This makes a Native ZFS on Linux implementation possible if you are willing to "download":http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/downloads and "build it":http://wiki.github.com/behlendorf/zfs/building-zfs yourself.

h2. 1.2 Why should I use a 64-bit system?

fn1.In the Solaris kernel it is common practice to make heavy use of the virtual address space because it is designed to work well. However, in the Linux kernel most memory is addressed with a physical address and use of the virtual address space is strongly discouraged. This is particularly true on 32-bit arches where the virtual address space is limited to roughly 100MiB by default. Using the virtual address space on 64-bit Linux kernels is also discouraged.  But in this case the address space is so much larger than physical memory it is not as much of an issue.

If you are bumping up against the virtual memory limit you will see this message in your system logs.  You can increase the virtual address size with the boot option _vmalloc=512M_.

<pre>
vmap allocation for size 4198400 failed: use vmalloc=<size> to increase size.

h2. 1.3 Why doesn't it build?

Building a kernel module against an arbitrary kernel version is a complicated thing to do.  Every distro has their own idea of how this should be done.  It depends on the base kernel version, any distro specific patches, and exactly how the kernel was configured and built.  If you run in to problems here are few thing to check.  If none of these things explain your problem please open up a new "SPL issue":http://github.com/behlendorf/spl/issues or a new "ZFS issue":http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues as appropriate.

* The kernel API changes frequently and kernels newer than 2.6.32 are not yet supported.
* Check for known "SPL":http://github.com/behlendorf/spl/issues/labels/Build%20Issue and "ZFS":http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues/labels/Build%20Issue build issues.
* There is also a list of  [[tested platforms]] you might find helpful.

h2. 1.4 How can I help?

The most helpful thing you can do is to try ZFS for Linux on your system and report any "issues":http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues.  If you like what you see and would like to contribute to the project please send "me":http://github.com/behlendorf an email.  There are quite a few open issues on the "issue tracker":http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues which need attention or if you have an idea of your own that is fine too.
